I'm a Data Scientist with 16 months of production experience building end-to-end ML systems that drive real business decisions. I specialize in time series forecasting, scalable data pipelines, and translating complex model outputs into actionable insights for cross-functional teams.

I don't just build models — I build systems that work reliably in the real world.

Currently at Intex Recreation Corp, previously interned across computer vision, supply chain ML, and cloud data engineering. UC Berkeley Master of Analytics, 4.0 GPA.

Interests:
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Data Science

Education:
- 🎓 Master of Analytics @ University of California, Berkeley
- 🎓 B.A. in Data Science @ University of California, Berkeley

## Work Experience
**Data Analyst @ Intex Recreation Corp. (_Long Beach, CA | October 2024 - Present_)**
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Built end-to-end demand forecasting system using Prophet, ARIMA, and LSTM on millions of transaction-level records; improved forecast accuracy by 18%.</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Designed modular data pipelines in Python and SQL separating ingestion, feature engineering, model training, and reporting layers for maintainability and reusability.</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Implemented monitoring layer tracking rolling accuracy metrics (MAPE, bias) and input feature distributions to detect drift and trigger retraining cycles.</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Modeled promotion-driven demand lift using causal analysis to isolate incremental sales impact from seasonal trends; reduced overstock risk by 15% (~$2.4M annual cost impact).</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Partnered with merchandising and marketing teams to operationalize model outputs into actionable inventory and pricing decisions.</span>

**Data Analyst Intern @ Synergies Intelligent Systems, Inc. (_Boston, NY | June 2024 - October 2024)**
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Built end-to-end computer vision pipeline using PyTorch and OpenCV with YOLOv8 object detection; reduced detection error by 13.3% and improved measurement accuracy by 22%.</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Enabled rapid retraining and deployment across multiple devices by designing a modular, production-ready ML pipeline architecture.</span>

**Data Analyst Intern @ Canadian Solar Inc. (_Walnut Creek, CA | May 2023 - July 2023_)**
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Reduced supply chain forecasting error from 23% to 8% using XGBoost and Random Forest models to predict inbound lead time across storage locations.</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Built interactive Power BI dashboards for scenario modeling and campaign performance tracking used by analysts and managers.</span>

**Data Engineer Intern @ Gotion Inc. (_Fremont, CA | May 2022 – August 2022_)**
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Built AWS-based ETL pipeline (S3, Lambda) processing 500,000+ daily records for EV battery telemetry data.</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Designed Grafana dashboards for real-time battery monitoring, boosting operational efficiency by 18%.</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">Developed Python scripts to decode CAN bus data used in automotive electronics.</span>


Selected Projects
======
## [Airbnb Recommendation System](https://github.com/Jessicalllll/AirbnbRecommendation)
![pictures](images/airbnb.webp){: .align-right width="300px"}

This project is an Airbnb Recommendation System designed to enhance user experience by providing personalized accommodation suggestions. By leveraging a combination of machine learning models—popularity-based, collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid approaches—the system accurately matches user preferences with available properties. The interactive dashboard, built with Dash and Plotly, allows users to dynamically adjust their preferences and receive immediate updates on recommendations. 

## [Waste Classification](https://github.com/Jessicalllll/WasteClassification)
![pictures](images/Wasteclass.webp){: .align-right width="300px"}

This project, the Automated Waste Classification System, utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to accurately classify different types of waste, such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal. This system aims to enhance waste management practices by promoting recycling and reducing landfill waste. By implementing models like Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Vision Transformer (ViT), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we achieve high accuracy and reliability in waste classification. This innovative approach addresses critical environmental challenges, fostering a more sustainable future.

## [IMF PRGT Funding Classifier](https://github.com/Jessicalllll/IMF_PRGT_Funding_Classifier)
![pictures](images/IMF.webp){: .align-right width="300px"}

The IMF PRGT Funding Classifier project aims to streamline the process of assessing eligibility for concessional loans under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) program. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the project builds predictive models that analyze economic and financial indicators to determine which low-income countries are likely to qualify for zero-interest loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This automated approach enhances efficiency, reduces manual review time, and ensures a more systematic evaluation process, ultimately supporting sustainable development and financial stability in eligible countries.
