Selected Projects
======
## [Airbnb Recommendation System](https://github.com/Jessicalllll/AirbnbRecommendation)
![pictures](images/airbnb.webp){: .align-right width="300px"}

This project is an Airbnb Recommendation System designed to enhance user experience by providing personalized accommodation suggestions. By leveraging a combination of machine learning modelsâ€”popularity-based, collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid approachesâ€”the system accurately matches user preferences with available properties. The interactive dashboard, built with Dash and Plotly, allows users to dynamically adjust their preferences and receive immediate updates on recommendations. 

## [Waste Classification](https://github.com/Jessicalllll/WasteClassification)
![pictures](images/Wasteclass.webp){: .align-right width="300px"}

This project, the Automated Waste Classification System, utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to accurately classify different types of waste, such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal. This system aims to enhance waste management practices by promoting recycling and reducing landfill waste. By implementing models like Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Vision Transformer (ViT), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we achieve high accuracy and reliability in waste classification. This innovative approach addresses critical environmental challenges, fostering a more sustainable future.


## [IMF PRGT Funding Classifier](https://github.com/Jessicalllll/IMF_PRGT_Funding_Classifier)
![pictures](images/IMF.webp){: .align-right width="300px"}

The IMF PRGT Funding Classifier project aims to streamline the process of assessing eligibility for concessional loans under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) program. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the project builds predictive models that analyze economic and financial indicators to determine which low-income countries are likely to qualify for zero-interest loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This automated approach enhances efficiency, reduces manual review time, and ensures a more systematic evaluation process, ultimately supporting sustainable development and financial stability in eligible countries.
